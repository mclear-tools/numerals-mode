* Simple Variables with Commas

Revenue = 1,000,000
Expenses = 250,000
Net_Income = Revenue - Expenses

Large_Number = 12,345,678.90
Small_Number = 1,234.56
Negative = -50,000

* Table with Comma Input

#+NAME: Budget

* Cross-Table References

Budget_Total_Amount = Budget.B5
Budget_Total_Tax = Budget.C5
Budget_Grand_Total = Budget.D5

Combined_Budget = Budget_Total_Amount + Large_Number

* Complex Calculations

Tax_Rate = 0.0765
FICA_Amount = Revenue * Tax_Rate
Total_Deductions = FICA_Amount + Expenses

Final_Result = Total_Deductions - 100,000

* Mixed Calculations

Simple_Sum = 1,000 + 2,000 + 3,000
With_Decimals = 1,234.56 + 2,345.67
Large_Calc = 1,000,000 - 250,000 + 50,000
