| TOTALS      | =SUM(B2:B5) | =SUM(C2:C5) | =SUM(D2:D5) | =SUM(E2:E5) |

* Cross-Table References

Monthly Average = expenses.TOTALS[3] / 3

3. Try different export commands:
   - M-x numerals-pandoc-export-to-html
   - M-x numerals-pandoc-export-to-pdf
   - M-x numerals-pandoc-export-to-docx
   
4. Verify that exported documents show:
   - Calculated values for all expressions
   - Table formulas replaced with results
   - Cross-table references resolved
   - All formatting preserved

5. Preview the preprocessed file:
   - M-x numerals-pandoc-preview-preprocessed
   
This should show what pandoc will receive as input.
